# A Reddit style website for a web development class. 

The requirement for this project was to create a forum based website where users can post threads and comments. No frameworks were allowed.

What follows below is a walkthrough of the website:

1.	This top navigation bar leads you to the three different boards on the website; liberal, libertarian, and conservative. The home page shows the popular threads sorted by popularity of votes that the user’s voted on.
2.	This is where you log in.
a.	Administrator profile: Username – admin. Password – 1234.
b.	Regular account: Username – Gluemeister. Password – 1234.
3.	A user can search for a post here. It will search all of the boards at once.
4.	For a user to create a post, they can click this button. A user must be logged in to post, however.

5.	After the person presses login (2), they get redirected to this page where a user can sign up or login. All of the fields are required. A user does not have to upload a picture though if they don’t want to.
6.	This is where a user can log in to access more features on the site.
7.	If a user forgot their password, they can click this link which will send them an email containing their password.

17.	This is the administrator page.
18.	An administrator can search the entire website by username, email or topic.
19.	An administrator can enable or disable users. If a user is “disabled”, they will not be able to log in until the administrator changes it to “enable”
20.	The page keeps track of users that have visited the website (more specifically if they visited the home page). Once they have visited the site, a red mark will show up where a user has visited the website from.
